  headline: "<strong>In September 2021,</strong>"
  content: I was awarded a grant from the Visual Resources Association Foundation
    to partner with the Tacoma Public Library's Northwest Room, to help digitize the
    500,000+ item Richards Collection, a repository of the commercial photography
    studio active in the Puget Sound <span class="s1">from</span> 1921 to 1980. The
    goal of the grant was to help digitize what was regarded as a "dark archive,"
    and focus on better representing Tacoma's historical BIPOC community.<br><br>Through
    a collaborative effort with Northwest Room librarian and project sponsor Spencer
    Bowman, we ultimately found that the collection was not so much "dark," as past
    digitization efforts were scattered, archiving practices were inconsistent, and
    the inherent nature of Richards' practice created a large amount of material which
    provided little contextual information for potential users.

    content: Determining this involved creating visualizations of the items that had
      been digitized, as well as visualizations of the largest gaps in the collection,
      to pinpoint where to investigate. Using these guides, I was able to determine
      the pockets were generally duplicate photos of an item which had already been
      digitized, or an item which held little contextual value for most patrons.

      was able to locate in the entire collection, portrays a worker securing lumber
      into a vault where it will be treated with arsenic to prevent rot. Even considering
      the early state of workplace safety in 1940, this photo illustrates how African
      American laborers were regarded in midcentury Tacoma, and may also provide some
      insight into the scarcity of representation within the Richards' collection"

    content: If African American workers were consistently given dangerous positions
      that might have resulted in legal repercussions, it's unlikely that the Richards'
      Studio photographers would be using them in the extensive marketing photos which
      they produced for industrial firms during this period.

  col_1:
    content: Approaching this project, I had assumed that the proximity of Tacoma
      and the neighboring Puyallup Reservation would make some amount of visual documentation
      inevitable. What I found was that the Richards Studio produced many more examples
      of Caucasian people in Native American dress than actual Indigenous communities.
      That said, one example of Native Americans in the Richards Collection felt significant.

    content: In <em>RSO-28</em>, a group which appears to be wearing Veteran of Foreign
      Wars (VFW) garrison hats and casual clothing stand alongside their wives and
      children and a Native American family in traditional dress on Owens Beach, a
      popular Tacoma park overlooking the Puget Sound.<br><br>While no context was
      included with this material and the Native American family is 'othered' through
      their differing dress and placement at the front of the group, the tone of the
      photo reads more like an effort of reconciliation than exploitation, with audience
      expressions ranging from cordial smiles to a respectful solemnity.
  col_3:
    headline: ''
    slug: ''
    content: Though this interpretation is vulnerable to my own projection, the public
      setting, mixed genders and diverse backgrounds of the group may help add nuance
      to our understanding of reconciliation efforts and the social mindset of fraternal
      organizations like the VFW in midcentury Tacoma.

    content: These themes of outreach are plain in perhaps the most historically significant
      photograph I discovered in the collection, and the only item which included
      an archival description written by Bob Richards. The note adhered onto the back
      of <em>RSO-40</em> in type-written paper begins:<br><br><em>"Marching forward,
      arm in arm with their fellow young Americans are girls of the Tacoma and Puyallup
      Valley Japanese American Citizens League, a substantial part of the national
      Nisei soldiers and white boys of the same companies, at the wind-up of the grand
      march as they danced in Tacoma's Odd Fellows Hall. Americans all -- and no doubt
      of it."</em>

    content: This photo, taken two months before the Pearl Harbor attacks, documents
      an event the Puyallup Valley Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League
      hosted in support of National Defense Week to help unify efforts between the
      250 Nisei (second generation) soldiers active at the Fort Lewis Army base and
      Caucasian soldiers. The evening included an informal dinner with Issei (first
      generation) family members, dancing and singing the American national anthem.
      The photo captures the relationship of the Japanese American community and their
      embeddedness within the US military and the Puget Sound before WWII and later
      incarceration.

    content: I made the most progress with unconventional photographic formats. These
      included oversized panorama film prints, which the studio often used for group
      photos, and Kodachrome Stereo Transparencies, which were used only briefly in
      the mid-1950s to document weddings and public events.

      then joining the images in Photoshop and fading from one another in a GIF file
      to recreate the 3D effect one would have originally experienced through a custom
      Kodak viewer.

    content: Finally, I am so happy that I pursued the Kodachrome 3D wedding materials
      in the Richards Collection. I was reluctant to look into it for the same reasons
      as the Richards yearbook photos; uniformity is the primary intention.
    headline: ''
    slug: ''
  col_2:
    content: Midcentury wedding photos had very defined templates that the Richards
      Studio catered to regardless of their clients or affiliated churches. That said,
      the Japanese American weddings captured in the collection align most closely
      to the material I hoped to promote with this grant project.

      a culture independent from the context of struggle and racism. The formal dress,
      ornamental arrangements and social ceremonies provide a unique insight into
      a resilient, joyful community, still thriving in the Pacific Northwest.</span>

  headline: "<strong>Conclusion</strong>"
  content: Reflecting on this project, I am grateful for the opportunity to interact
    with the very talented and insightful staff of the Northwest Room. Being able
    to learn from and collaborate with this group in person during the pandemic has
    been an incredibly special archive experience, and I am deeply indebted to the
    Visual Resources Association Foundation for connecting me with this institution,
    and hopefully contributing over time to the greater Tacoma community.
