  headline: "<strong>In September 2021,</strong>"
  content: I was awarded a grant from the Visual Resources Association Foundation
    to partner with the Tacoma Public Library's Northwest Room, to help digitize the
    500,000+ item Richards Collection, a repository of the commercial photography
    studio active in the Puget Sound <span class="s1">from</span> 1921 to 1980. The
    goal of the grant was to help digitize what was regarded as a "dark archive,"
    and focus on better representing Tacoma's historical BIPOC community.<br><br>Through
    a collaborative effort with Northwest Room librarian and project sponsor Spencer
    Bowman, we ultimately found that the collection was not so much "dark," as past
    digitization efforts were scattered, archiving practices were inconsistent, and
    the inherent nature of Richards' practice created a large amount of material which
    provided little contextual information for potential users.

      size of the collection, it represents a 60% increase in BIPOC representation
      from the state of the collection when I began this work in September.</strong>"

      backgrounds of the people occupying the frame and tell a much broader story
      about the evolving social fabric of Tacoma in the twentieth century.</strong>"

    content: Determining this involved creating visualizations of the items that had
      been digitized, as well as visualizations of the largest gaps in the collection,
      to pinpoint where to investigate. Using these guides, I was able to determine
      the pockets were generally duplicate photos of an item which had already been
      digitized, or an item which held little contextual value for most patrons.
